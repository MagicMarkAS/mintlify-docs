# Set Up a Custom Domain
A custom domain adds professionalism and brand consistency to your agency. Here's how to set it up:

Navigate to the Custom Domain section.
Enter your desired domain (e.g., ai.youragency.com).
Follow the provided instructions to update your DNS records.
Wait for DNS propagation (usually 24-48 hours).
Once verified, your custom domain will be active.

<Tip>
Using a subdomain like 'ai.youragency.com' or 'chat.youragency.com' can help separate your AI services from your main website while maintaining brand consistency.
