# Configure Email Routing
Proper email configuration ensures smooth communication with your clients:

In the Email tab, enter your Custom Email Domain (e.g., @ai.youragency.com).
Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records as provided in the Email tab instructions.
Enter your support email address (e.g., support@youragency.com).
Provide your business address for the email footer.

<Note>
The custom email domain will be used for all platform-generated emails, including notifications and invitations. Ensure it's professional and aligned with your brand.
