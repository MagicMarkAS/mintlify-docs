## Font Family
#
**Font family**: Choose from any of the free [Google fonts](Google_font). 

Example: `DM Sans`


<Tip>
  You can change the fonts of specific parts (like header and input field) using custom CSS.
</Tip>

#
**Inherit Font**: Type "inherit" to use the same font as you or your clients webpage.

<Warning type="warning">
  Not recommended, as this may break the agent – use at your own **risk**.
</Warning>



## Widget Language
#
**Language Code**: Glowstudio uses [ISO 639-1 language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) to set the language, this means your widget can have literally **any** language.

Example: English will be `en`.
#

**Automatic Translation**: Labels and placeholders will be automatically translated to your chosen language. (Title and branding will keep their original language and text. Change those manually to your preferred language)

## Buttons Layout
#
Customize the layout and look of the buttons used in your agent's interface. There are three options to consider with each unique uses cases. Example, `in footer`or `horizontal` is often used as a way to automatically generate follow up questions (**similar to ms co-pilot**) to guide the user through the conversation with ease.

  <Tab title="Vertical">

    borderRadius: '12px',
    overflow: 'hidden'}}></img>

></video>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 3. Launch Avatar

Set the images that will represent your agent visually.

<Callout type="note">
  You can either upload an image or provide a valid image link/url. The max size is: 0.5MB per image. We recommend using a square image with at least 400px x 400px for optimal clarity.
</Callout>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Launch Avatar Image">
    Image for the chat bubble. Setting this image alone will default to all other images on the widget except background.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Header Image">
    Chat icon in the top left corner of the agent.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Banner Image">
    Display image at the top of the chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Chat Avatar">
    Main image for the agent's chat messages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Background Chat Image">
    Background for the chat section of the widget. This background has a low default opacity and might not be as visible if the image is very light. Settings can be modified with custom CSS.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Custom Theme

Personalize your agent's color scheme to align with your brand.

### Preset themes

You can choose between six predefined themes that work in both light and dark mode.

<Tip>
  You can set your agent to light or dark mode. This is nice for clients with darker websites as the agent will fit right in to the branding.
</Tip>

### Autogen Theme from Color

Recommended: Automatically generate a theme based on your primary color.

<Callout type="warning">
  Visibility Note: Ensure white text on top of the primary color is clearly visible and experiment with all kinds of color combinations.
</Callout>

### Manual Set Theme Colors

**Custom Colors**: Manually input your theme colors using HEX codes or the color palettes available in the designer.

Example: `#F34534`

<Tip>
  All colors and elements can be modified using custom CSS.
</Tip>

## Showcasing the agent

It's essential to know how the agent behaves and looks before letting a client test it. Glowstudio has two options for testing, right from the agent designer.

1. **Prototype**: Your clients will want to test a demo of their agent. Using the prototype link is a great way to do that. If you have whitelabeling included in your tier, the link will have your custom domain and branding!

2. **Demo**: It's not always easy to visualize how the agent will look on a website. The demo link lets you test it out in chat bubble format, so you get an idea of how the client will experience it on their website.

### Additional Tips

- **Save Regularly**: Remember to always save your progress to prevent the loss of your beautiful designs.
- **Thorough Testing**: Test your agent thoroughly to ensure all settings and features are working as intended.

## Example: GymBuddy GPT

Here is a test of the agent used in the guide above. Give it a try:
