Using the Debug Screen
The debug screen is a powerful tool for testing and optimizing your agent's knowledge. Here's what you can expect to see:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Returned Chunks" icon="puzzle-piece">
    View all text chunks that match your query, along with their similarity scores.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Information" icon="file-lines">
    See the source document name and description for each chunk.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token Usage" icon="calculator">
    Monitor both input and output token consumption for each query.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Performance" icon="chart-line">
    Evaluate how different [AI models](AImodels) perform with your knowledge base.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
Understanding Similarity Scores
<Tooltip tip="A similarity score measures how closely a chunk of text matches your query. Higher scores indicate greater relevance.">Similarity scores</Tooltip> help you gauge the relevance of returned chunks to your query. This is crucial for retrieving the most useful information.
Token Usage Breakdown
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Input Tokens">
    The combined tokens from your query and the relevant chunks retrieved from the knowledge base.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Output Tokens">
    The number of tokens generated by the model in its response, representing the model's answer based on the input context.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
<Tip>
  Monitoring token usage is especially important for cost-sensitive clients aiming to minimize credit and token consumption.
