## What is a Knowledge Base?  

 
 

   

 
 

A Knowledge Base is a repository of information that your AI agents use to retrieve accurate and relevant responses to user queries. This repository can include documents, FAQs, manuals, and other structured data. The system utilizes retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which extracts information from a vector database.

## What is a RAG System?  

 
 

  # 

 
 

The RAG system combines two powerful components that ensures your agents deliver highly accurate and contextually relevant responses:  

 
 

>**Retrieval:** Searches the Knowledge Base to find relevant information.  

 
 

> **Augmented Generation:** Uses the retrieved information to generate precise and contextually accurate responses using one of the LLMs available in Glowstudio.
