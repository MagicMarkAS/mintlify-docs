AI thrives on context. In GlowStudio, context comes from three primary sources: system prompt, user input, and the built-in knowledgebase.

### Providing Effective Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    Clearly define the problem, audience, and desired outcome to keep responses relevant and contextually driven.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Leverage the Knowledge Base">
    GlowStudio's knowledge base provides a layer of information on top of the model's training data, ensuring consistent and accurate responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Boundaries">
    Inform the AI about any limitations or constraints. This ensures the model always keeps to its task and context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Roles">
    Specify the role or persona the AI should adopt for more contextual interactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
While more context is generally better, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on details that directly impact the model's task.
