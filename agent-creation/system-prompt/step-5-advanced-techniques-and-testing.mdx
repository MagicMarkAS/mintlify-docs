  <Card title="Taking a deep breath" icon="wind">
    Encourage the AI to think methodically by using phrases like:
    - "Take a deep breath and think about what you are going to respond before writing it."
    - "Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step."
CopyThis helps the AI to slow down and process the information more thoroughly, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.

  <Card title="Highlighting Importance" icon="exclamation">
    Highlight the critical nature of the task with phrases such as:
    - "This is a life or death situation. It's critical that your response is correct."
    - "This is critical to the survival of my business"
CopyThis technique can make the AI prioritize accuracy and importance, resulting in more focused and precise outputs.

## Example Prompt Using Both Techniques

<CodeBlock>

```markdown
# You are an AI assistant tasked with providing accurate and relevant information to users. Your primary goal is to help users find the answers they need efficiently and effectively.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

## When responding to user queries, follow these guidelines:

1. Carefully read and understand the user's question.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Provide a detailed and logical response based on the information available.

This is a **life or death situation**. It's critical your response is correct.

# Iterate and Test
Creating the best possible agent involves continuously refining your prompts. Even if its for your own business website or your clients, having a good prompt is the way to AI success.

### Steps for crafting the best possible prompt based on agent's performance or user feedback:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Test Scenarios">
    Develop a diverse set of test cases that cover various user intents and edge cases (Can be easily created with ChatGPT).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate Responses">
    Assess the AI's responses for accuracy, relevance, and adherence to guidelines.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Weaknesses">
    Note any areas where the AI's performance falls short of expectations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine the Prompt">
    Adjust the prompt to address identified weaknesses and improve overall performance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat">
    Continuously test and refine the prompt to achieve optimal results.
  </Step>
</Steps>


Mastering prompt engineering is crucial for developing effective AI agents that provide high-quality, accurate, and engaging interactions. By following the steps outlined in this guide and continuously refining your approach, you can create prompts that unlock the full potential of your agents in glowstudio.


Remember that prompt engineering is an iterative process. Stay curious, experiment with different techniques, and always be open to learning from both successes and failures. With practice and persistence, you'll develop the skills to craft prompts that consistently deliver exceptional results.
