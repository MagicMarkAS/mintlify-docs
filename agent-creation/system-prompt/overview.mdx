Prompt Engineering Overview
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). A well-designed prompt can significantly enhance the quality, relevance, and safety of AI-generated responses. This guide will walk you through the key concepts and best practices in prompt engineering.


### The Prompt Input Field
Here's a screenshot of the prompt input field in GlowStudio:

<Info>
  Remember to always include the variables `{kb_context}` and `{about_context}` in your prompt. Without these, the agent won't have access to the retrieved chunks from the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

Key Concepts

  <Accordion title="Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning" icon="sitemap">
    Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning is a technique that involves breaking down complex problems into a series of intermediate steps. This approach helps the AI model to:
Copy1. Understand the problem more thoroughly
2. Show its reasoning process
3. Arrive at more accurate conclusions

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```markdown Human Input
  What's the result of 25 * 18?
  ```
  ```markdown AI Response
  Let's approach this step-by-step:

  1. First, let's break down 25 * 18 into (20 + 5) * 18
  2. Now we can calculate:
     a) 20 * 18 = 360
     b) 5 * 18 = 90
  3. Adding these results:
     360 + 90 = 450

  Therefore, 25 * 18 = 450
  ```

  <Accordion title="Few-Shot Learning" icon="graduation-cap">
    Few-shot learning is a technique where you provide the AI with a small number of examples to guide its understanding of the task. This can be particularly useful when you want the AI to follow a specific format or style in its responses.
Copy- One-shot learning: Providing one example
- Two-shot learning: Providing two examples
- Few-shot learning: Providing a few (typically 3-5) examples

**Example:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```markdown Human Input
  Translate the following English phrases to French. Here are two examples:

  English: Hello, how are you?
  French: Bonjour, comment allez-vous ?

  English: Where is the nearest restaurant?
  French: Où est le restaurant le plus proche ?

  Now, translate this:
  English: I would like to book a hotel room.
  ```
  ```markdown AI Response
  Based on the examples provided, here's the translation:

  English: I would like to book a hotel room.
  French: Je voudrais réserver une chambre d'hôtel.
  ```
