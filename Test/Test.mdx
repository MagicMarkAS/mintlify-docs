<Accordion title="Setting Up Your Agency: A Comprehensive Guide">
Follow these detailed steps to set up and optimize your agency on our AI platform:

<Steps>

<Step title="Configure the Overview Tab">
The Overview tab is your agency's command center. Here's what you can do:

1. Set your agency's name: Choose a name that reflects your brand identity.
2. Define your branding text (URL): This will be part of your agency's unique URL on our platform.
3. Generate a secret key: This key provides secure access to all your agency's widgets.
4. Upload your agency logo: Ensure it's a high-quality image that represents your brand well.

<Info>
Your secret key is crucial for security. You can regenerate it at any time by clicking the "Regen Secret" button in the Overview tab. It's recommended to rotate this key periodically for enhanced security.

<Step title="Set Up a Custom Domain">
A custom domain adds professionalism and brand consistency to your agency. Here's how to set it up:

Navigate to the Custom Domain section.
Enter your desired domain (e.g., ai.youragency.com).
Follow the provided instructions to update your DNS records.
Wait for DNS propagation (usually 24-48 hours).
Once verified, your custom domain will be active.

Using a subdomain like 'ai.youragency.com' or 'chat.youragency.com' can help separate your AI services from your main website while maintaining brand consistency.
